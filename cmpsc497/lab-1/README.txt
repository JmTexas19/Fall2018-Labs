Make sure Anaconda is installed properly. Open Spyder to write a new Python program.

 

The Python List data type is one of the most used data types and widely used for data science.

Read the manual on Python List and Nested List:

Practice the use of Lists to do the following:

Create an 8 by 8 matrix M of numbers using nested lists. Fill it with all 3s.

Create an 8 by 8 matrix O of numbers using nested lists. Fill each row with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Create a variable n with any value>1.

Scalar multiplication: Programmatically calculate the product of M with n. Print the resulting matrix. 

Matrix multiplication: Programmatically calculate the matrix product of M with O. Print the resulting matrix MO.

Minimum: Create a new 8 by 9 matrix D, where D is a duplicate of MO with the 9th column filled with the minimum of the current row. Print the resulting matrix D.

Since this is a practice on Lists, you are not to use methods of numpy.
